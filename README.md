# vim_configs

These are my vim configurations. I have included my vimrc and will also include my set up for running vim on VS Code.

## Tips

Leader Key: I change my leader key to double tap Space Bar. Ctrl is just too far out and I have found that just doing a double tap on space bar is way easier. 
Esc Key: Please do yourself a favor and map your CapsLock key on your keyboard to esc. 

## Workspace

Keyboard: [GK66](https://www.amazon.com/WYL-Mechanical-Bluetooth-Split-spacebar-Hot-swappable/dp/B08DTTTPH5)
 - Space key is split into two. I have mapped left space key to Command key and the right to space bar. So much more comfortable.
